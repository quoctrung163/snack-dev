### Environment Variables
There are a few environment variables you can set to adjust the setup to your needs

| Variable         | Default            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`           | `8500`             | Port number your application will be served on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `HOST`           | `http://localhost` | Host (including protocol!) your application will be served on. This is usually neglectable as most of the time your application will be served via remote proxy (e.g. Nginx) on localhost. **Note:** this is only for convenience. The server itself will not be bound exclusively to that host. |
| `DEVSERVER_HOST` | `http://localhost` | Optional. Different host for the Webpack Dev Server to be served on.|
